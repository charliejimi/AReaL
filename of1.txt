(00:00) so the preposition of is about possession right wrong can I say the car of John nope [Music] now the dictionary does say that one of the meanings of the preposition of is possession and that's true it is a surface application of the logic it's possible but that's not the core idea that's not the logic and so I want you to forget that for now okay just don't attach those two together the preposition of seems very very simple and in a way it is but especially if you come from a language like Spanish or French that has a Latin
(00:54) base this little preposition can be extremely confusing in fact even if you are an advanced speaker there might be some uses of the preposition of that will surprise you so don't underestimate this lesson now the very first thing we have to talk about really quick is the pronunciation of this word because many many many many many English learners pronounce this word and the word off very similarly these sound completely different and it often is a point that makes you harder to understand of is a schwa sound plus the sound v spelled
(01:43) with an F but it's V if you don't know what the schwa sound is I have a video right here for the pronunciation course so this is of of we often drop the V that's a different point we won't worry about that here but that vowel sound has to be a schwa sound very important in the word off it's that v vowel in the back ah link to that video right here off and does have an F sound so make sure that you are pronouncing it correctly because it will make you much easier to understand so what's going on with this preposition of how can something so
(02:27) small so basic so common it's the most common preposition in English how can something so seemingly simple cause problems well there's a trick before we actually talk about the logic itself there's one important concept that you have to understand and this actually might be controversial but the preposition of simply shows the relationship of something to itself I'll say that again the preposition of simply shows the relationship of something to itself the preposition of is sort of just the most basic of connectors we
(03:13) know that the definition of a preposition is to show the relationship between two things and for all other prepositions there is not just the connection there in the preposition but also the specific meaning of that preposition based on the logic so if we say on write a very simple example the keys are on the table so that shows the relationship and it connects keys and table the preposition of doesn't have any special meaning in itself that's why I said that it shows the relationship of something to itself now that isn't
(03:56) always easy to see and as we go through some of these examples I will sort of point out that idea but keep that in mind as we talk about the logic and the example sentences so what is the logic of the preposition of well it has two parts but these parts are more like two sides of the same coin two ways to look at the same thing the first part of the logic or the first side of the coin is the idea of a part the second part of the logic or the second side of that coin is the idea of content which includes something being made of
(04:41) something else now I know that can be confusing and very abstract it will make a lot more sense as we go through the examples and let's go ahead and look at these examples just keep that in mind as we continue let's look at the examples in Group one the key word or a phrase for this group is part the last page of the book is blank this one is extremely simple a book has a first page a last page and many other pages each of these pages is like one individual piece or part of the book so page is a more specific version of the
(05:26) word part another way to say this is the books last page is blank as you can see in this case we can also use possession with apostrophe s today is the first of June June has 30 days and the first day is one of them so the first day is one part of June day is a more specific word for part in this case thirty days of the month thirty parts of the month another way to say this is today is June first this is the more common way to say it I've never been north of Los Angeles note that this sentence does not mean
(06:12) the north part of Los Angeles instead it means any location that is in the direction north starting from Los Angeles if you want to talk about the north part of Los Angeles we say I've never been to North Los Angeles now we're talking about the top area of the city on a map so how does the example sentence mean a part we're looking at all the area outside of Los Angeles the rest of the world or the rest of the country at least and based on that area we're talking about the part of it that is specifically northward from where Los
(06:53) Angeles is next he got 17 out of 20 on his test the test has 20 questions so there are 20 points in total he answered 17 questions correctly in this case the word point is a specific word for part so each point is one part of the total score next we have I like the color of the sky at sunset color is a part more aspect of this guy group 2 the key word or phrase in this group is content this table is made of wood if we try to say that the table is part of the wood that doesn't make any sense here we're talking about the material
(07:45) that something is made out of the wood is the content or material of the table it's what the table consists of or is composed of which is why we usually use the preposition of with those verbs all of these are different ways to talk about the same idea please note that normally when we talk about the contents of a table we actually mean what's inside the drawers of the table this is because content or contents is usually used with the meaning to contain what is inside the desk this table is made from wood this table is made out of wood
(08:29) this table is made with wood this is a picture of a dog this is one of the reasons why I recommend that you don't think about the preposition of as possession this is a common mistake here this is a picture of a dog we're saying that the is what you see in the picture okay so how does the logic apply is picture a part of dog it's clear that the dog is in the picture which means that the dog is the content of the picture the next example is very very interesting and a very useful structure I've always thought of him as an interesting person
(09:13) the key is this him as an interesting person is one single idea my thought is not part of him but him as an interesting person is the content of my thought in other words when I think of him the idea interesting person appears in my mind notice in this case that we have a verb thought plus the preposition of plus a noun or pronoun him I've always dreamed of living by the ocean the word dream in this context doesn't mean a dream that you have while you sleep it means something that you really want to do in this case living by
(10:05) the ocean is one idea or chunk and it's the content of my dream so in this case we have a verb dreamed plus the preposition of plus a second verb living in other words when we use the preposition of with a verb after it that verb is the content of the verb that's before the preposition of when we use this structure I like the idea of the learning many languages so now we have a noun and then the preposition of and then another verb this works exactly the same in this case learning many languages is the content of the idea
(10:57) which I like group 3 [Music] the key word or phrase in this group is part and content when we're talking about the preposition of remember this preposition is just the most basic of prepositions it's just a simple little connector and it basically shows the relationship of something to itself so this idea of part and content which are really just two ways of looking at the same thing they can both apply at the same time depending on the context and what we're talking about the main point here is that it doesn't really matter
(11:41) for this preposition sometimes one part of the logic might seem to clearly apply and the other part not but because there are two ways to look at the same thing it doesn't matter I drink five cups of coffee imagine you have a big pot of coffee you take one cup of it that's one part of the total amount of coffee in the pot so here cup is a specific word for part this sentence is also about content what is in the cup coffee before we continue there is a very important idea that we have to talk about when we're talking
(12:23) about the logic of prepositions there are what I call one-way prepositions and two-way prepositions now there are actually a couple different ways that this idea can apply but most prepositions are one-way prepositions so that means that just as you expect the logic applies with the flow of the sentence from left to right the keys are on the table however a two-way preposition can apply both ways with the preposition of we actually see that with a part we go from left to right something is part of something else but you probably
(13:14) noticed that when we talk about content or what something is made of the logic actually applies in the opposite direction it flows from right to left now this doesn't really matter and don't let this be more confusing than it has to be it just means that the logic still applies but it's being applied in a way that is harder to see again most prepositions are one-way prepositions and we don't have this problem our next example he died of a heart attack in the dictionary you will find this example labeled as the cause of something now
(13:55) this is true it is a cause or an origin on the surface but this can be misleading and confusing for the logic or the core idea so in he died of a heart attack where is the part and where is the content a heart attack has a beginning a middle and an end which are all parts as well as a result did he survive or did he not it's easy to see that death he died is the result which means that this is the part of the heart attack that we're talking about however in an abstract way we can also say that the heart attack is
(14:39) the content of his death in other words his death is made of a heart attack or consists of a heart attack how did he die a car crash a stabbing no a heart attack next I am afraid of spiders my fear is not part of spiders however spiders are the content of my fear now this sentence is a little weird notice that if I have more than one fear we can say that spiders are one part of my fear so in this case we also have a part but part goes the opposite direction normal normally part is a to be and content is B to a that in this case part
(15:35) and content are both B to a notice that we can say one of the things parts that I'm afraid of is spiders this is a strange and rare example where the logic goes in the opposite direction but the main point is this the logic still works perfectly five remember here we're talking about two sides to the same coin and it actually doesn't matter all that much now for group for the keyword or phrase here is part and content plus implied information I know right this just it doesn't end it doesn't end all this part and content what is going on
(16:29) okay so this group is the most difficult because the sentences include implied information so nothing's really changing from group 3 it's just there's this extra information that is not said implied information is information that's not actually said but that is there from the context normally with the preposition of the logic will either be a to B or B to a in terms of the sentence flow but we can also have C a B and C let's look at a couple of specific examples there's a discount of 20% on all purchases in this case 20% is the
(17:19) content of the discount but discount clearly isn't part of 20% so it's not going both ways hmm what's happening here well that's the implied information we're saying 20% which implies a total price 20% is the part specifically it's part of the total price so what we're really saying is there's a discount of 20% of the total price on all purchases it's more like B to a plus B to C put another way B is the content of a 20% is the content of the discount but B is also a part of C the amount that is discounted or removed from the total is part of the
(18:19) original total if the total price is $10 then 20% is $2 meaning that $2 is the content of the discount because it's the specific amount that will be removed from the total this is B to a however at the same time we're also implying that $2 is part of the original $10 this is B to C another way to think about it imagine you have a pie with 10 pieces or parts and you take two pieces this leaves eight pieces now there's an interesting alternative here there's a 20% discount on all purchases if we say it this way we're using 20% like an
(19:12) adjective to describe the word discount now I know all of that can be very confusing so let's look at one more example here and maybe it will become clearer I only got two hours of sleep last night can you see it the a B and C are moved around a little bit but we still have the same thing happening sleep is the content of the two hours those two hours a consists of sleeping B so we have the normal B to a but where's the part in this sentence well each hour of the night is a part of the night more specifically
(19:58) we're talking about hours that are used for sleeping so the total number of hours is the implied information and then we remove two of those hours because those are the hours that you were sleeping in the previous example it was b2c in this example it's actually a to see because we're removing the two hours a from the implied total number of hours see again it's like a pizza with ten pieces the exact connection between a B and C might change but the idea is exactly the same another way to save this sentence I only slept for two hours
(20:46) last night okay so I know that the preposition of is quite abstract but that's okay let me know down below if you have any questions or comments and you can continue with the course with the preposition to when you are ready thank you so much for watching another English x lesson and I will see you guys in the next one
